**Objective**:
The objective of a Rock, Paper, Scissors game implemented in Python is to provide an interactive and enjoyable way for users to engage in a simple game of chance. Specifically, the goals are:

1. **Implement Game Logic**: Accurately apply the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors to determine the winner based on user and computer choices.
2. **Enhance User Experience**: Allow users to easily play and understand the game, including providing clear prompts, results, and options for replaying the game.
3. **Demonstrate Basic Programming Concepts**: Use fundamental Python programming techniques such as handling user input, generating random values, and controlling game flow.



**Key Activities:**
 In a Rock, Paper, Scissors game implemented using Python, the key activities are:

1. **User Input Handling**: Capture and validate the user's choice (rock, paper, or scissors).
2. **Computer Choice Generation**: Randomly select a choice for the computer.
3. **Result Determination**: Compare the user's choice with the computer's choice to determine the winner based on game rules.
4. **Output Display**: Show the results of the game, including the computer's choice and the outcome (win, lose, or tie).
5. **Replay Option**: Allow the user to play multiple rounds or exit the game based on their input.


**TECHNOLOGIES USED:**

A Python-based Rock,Paper,Scissors Game can be built using the following technologies:
In a Rock, Paper, Scissors game implemented in Python, the primary technologies used include:

1. **Python Programming Language**: For writing the game's logic and handling user interactions.
2. **Standard Library (`random`)**: For generating random choices for the computer player.

These technologies facilitate the core functionality of the game, such as user input, decision-making, and result determination.
